# Language

`.jog` is Joggle's only source and readable IR format. It describes reusable
modules, functions, types, control flow, and explicit compile-time workflows.
It is intentionally not a second pipeline or kernel language.

The implemented surface is conventional:

```jog
module demo
use tensor

fn matmul<T, M, N, K>(
  a: tensor<T, [M, K]>,
  b: tensor<T, [K, N]>
) -> tensor<T, [M, N]> {
  var c = tensor<T, [M, N]>(0)
  for i in 0..M, j in 0..N {
    var sum = T(0)
    for k in 0..K {
      sum += a[i, k] * b[k, j]
    }
    c[i, j] = sum
  }
  return c
}
```

The language uses ordinary `module`, `use`, `fn`, `let`, `var`, `for`, `if`,
and `return`. It has generics, structural types, attributes, and overloadable
operators. It has no `graph`, `kernel`, `compute`, `map`, `fold`, `rewrite`,
`region`, or `pass` syntax.

Multiple loop variables denote a lexically nested Cartesian product. A source
may be a range or any compile-time list, so the same form traverses tensor
indices and IR collections. `return` is always an ordinary statement in the
function block. Mutable values crossing a `for` or `if` boundary become block
arguments, results, and an internal `yield`; these mechanics remain visible to
C++ transforms but are recovered as normal source syntax by the printer.

Calls, literals, indexing, unary operators, and common binary operators are
implemented. Operators normalize to ordinary function calls such as
`operator +` and `operator []`; adding a concrete overload does not add a new
IR operation kind.

`let` bindings are immutable. `var` bindings may be reassigned with `=` or
`+=`, and tensor-like values may use `value[i, j] = next`. The latter normalizes
to a call of `operator []=` returning the updated value, so mutation remains an
explicit value flow.

Canonical printing deliberately discards comments and incidental whitespace.
Printing and reparsing must produce a structurally equal module.

Attributes use the same literal syntax wherever constant metadata is needed:

```jog
{axis: 1, pads: [0, -1], raw: hex"007fff", label: "weight"}
```

The structural `Attr` values are `nil`, `bool`, signed integer, `f64`, `str`,
`bytes`, list, and string-keyed dictionary. Byte strings print as lowercase hex
and cross the native ABI without being treated as UTF-8.

### Compile-time functions

There is no separate pass syntax. Any ordinary function accepting a `Mod` may
be selected explicitly by the embedding API or CLI:

```sh
joggle run opt.fold_add_zero model.jog -M modules
```

Calls inside that function remain ordinary calls. Compile-time execution
supports structured `for` and `if`, scalar operators, lists, and the universal
`Mod`, `Fn`, `Blk`, `Op`, and `Val` handles exposed by `ir`. Failed execution is
transactional. It does not evaluate arbitrary model functions or silently run
transforms while parsing.

Function attributes beyond `[host]`, user type declarations, and full typed
overload resolution remain for later slices. They will extend this one language
rather than introduce pipeline or kernel syntax.
